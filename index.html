            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Cloud Camous(Website for my College)</h3>
            <p>During my college days I coordinated with my friends to build a website for our campus named Cloud campus. The objective of building the website is to empower the students to learn on their own terms at their own place, wherever and whenever they want to. Cloud Campus learning process is not just limited to textbooks instead it is enhanced for group learning. This project illustrates the future education will be through the internet. Such educational content can be delivering to students at their doorsteps through the cloud campus "as a service”. It also makes possible the implementation of a universal curriculum across the nation; enabling students across college acquire the same experience in education.
